        if top left: place randomly

        otherwise;
            check constraints of tile above and tile to left
                if tile above points down (tiles 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15)
                    then we need a tile that points up (1,3,5,7,12,13,14,15)
                if the tile left points right ()
                    then we need a tile that points left (fill inthis)
                if both of these are true, we need one that points up and left 
                handle edge cases too
            decide on tile (random of options?)
            place tile at row, column
                do math to determine what is the center of the tile based on row,column and grid properties
            store what tile you are placing in a matrix for future reference(constraint check)

            setOfPossibleTiles = everything
            check if tike is not in first row and tile above has line down
                set of possibletiles intersect with up
            check if tike is not in first col and tile left has line right
                set of possibletiles intersect with left
            pick random tile from set of possible tiles
